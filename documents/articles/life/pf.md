# America sucks at money

I've lost track of how many times friends, family, and colleagues bitch about money. Look, it really is not that hard. The problem is twofold; generational bad habits, and our education system couldn't give two craps about telling you the way out. The fact is, it's gonna take an overhaul of your financial habits to end your monetary woes, and you may not know where to even begin. So, in this article, I'm going to give you a primer on a way you *can* get out of money problems once and for all.

## Disclaimer

I'm a software developer - not an investment or personal finance adviser. This document constituites my opinion and personalised strategy for investment and personal finance, as well as my best understanding of available laws and plans. It does *not* constitute professionally-administered financial or investment advice of any kind. Everyone has different needs and should talk to a <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/what-is-a-fiduciary-financial-advisor-a-guide-to-the-fiduciary-duty">*fiduciary* investment adviser</a> to create the plan that works best for them.

# Nothing beats higher income

We'll be talking mainly about ways I've cut my expenses and places I've parked my money, but the role of higher income cannot be overlooked. You can live extremely efficient on minimum wage, but it's still *minimum wage*, and at best you'll only be making the most out of an underlying bad situation. Always be on the lookout for ways you can generate more and higher income. You don't always *need* higher income to achieve financial success, but it always, always helps. And of course, don't end up doing things that you think will make you money, but end up costing you more.

# Build an emergency fund

This alone will stop most of your money-related heart attacks well before you retire, and force the good savings habits you'll need as you scale up. I personally maintain an emergency fund of around $20,000 in cash. If you're single, you can probably get away with $10,000-$15,000. This could just be a plain old savings account at your bank where it grows almost insignificantly. Immediate piece of mind is the real reason you need an emergency fund. Even if this takes you years of saving - do it. You won't regret it when your car breaks down, your water heater breaks down, the city decides to be an ass, or you need a $600 band-aid in an American ER. Emergencies happen: be prepared. $10,000 may seem like a lot, but that's the top end of a big emergency. Don't skip this step; get it done first. You *need* an emergency fund.

# Get out of debt

After you get a good emergency fund, it's time to attack debt. **Debt is the enemy.** The worst of it all: unsecured, high-interest debt. ("Unsecured" is a fancy term for credit card debt and personal loans.) The very first thing I made sure to do was to start eliminating any debt that had greater than 3-4% interest rate annually, by paying way over the monthly minimum payment until it finally disappeared. If you look carefully at your interest rate for credit card, student, and used auto loans, you'll probably find that you don't have a rate under 3-4%. If that's the case - start getting rid of it!

For debts under 3-4%, I'd say you can continue to pay the minimums on them. The remaining money that would otherwise go on your debt is better put in an investment like a total stock market fund. Don't have *too* many outstanding low-interest debts - a low-interest loan is still money you need to pay back.

## Small Monthly Expenses

Don't forget to track all the small monthly expenses - dining out, subscriptions, etc. These things add up very quick. There's no way around it - a change in lifestyle is needed to change what you spend. Don't be afraid to try new things - cheaper things. Like eating right, it pays off massively in the long run.

# Take advantage of your work benefits

Work probably offers you both health and retirement benefits. The next step is using those as best as you can.

* Choosing the right health insurance

	Thanks to decades of Congressional mismanagement, health insurance in the US is an incomprehensible mishmosh of jargon, acronyms, and arcane rules that the average consumer couldn't possibly hope to navigate. Here's the three letters you'll want to check out in particular: **HSA**.

	An abbreviation of *Health Savings Account*, HSAs are a valuable investment vehicle available to those who select a high-deductible plan. The big two advantages of an HSA: being *completely* untaxed (in deposit, earnings, or spending for medical expenses exclusively) and being investable. The idea of the HSA is that you use this fund to cover the costs of your high deductible. An HSA can really work out for you if you're otherwise healthy, have low medical expenses, and have enough income to max out the annual limit ($3,500 individual/$7,000 family as of this writing). While investable, I don't normally suggest investing them because of the importance of being able to cover medical expenses; if your risk tolerance is lower, you may want to take advantage of this, particularly because the earnings are *completely untaxed* if spent for medical purposes only.

	An HSA may not be your best option if you have frequent, expensive medical needs. Everyone's medical needs are different, so discuss this with a fiduciary investment adviser.

* Contributing to retirement accounts

	401(k)s have taken the place of pensions since the mid-eighties; don't cry any tears for the downfall of relatively un-diverse pensions that have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-07/as-ge-breakup-talk-heats-up-a-31-billion-problem-is-overlooked">routinely</a> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sears-bankruptcy-pension-default-20181011-story.html">failed</a>. 401(k) lets you contribute tax-deferred money for retirement straight into safer, more diverse stock market and bond market investments; taking advantage of this if it is offered should be considered *non-optional*. Your employer may even offer you a match, meaning that they contribute what you contribute up to a predetermined amount - this is free money, don't turn it down because you don't understand it!

	401(k) accounts typically have a high annual limit - $19,000 as of this writing. A lot of people will recommend you max it out - I personally don't suggest that if you want to retire earlier, because the money will be inaccessible until roughly age 60 per IRS rules. If you're planning on working until your mid-sixties, then this isn't bad advice. Overall, you should plan on contributing enough to get your match, plus any additional amount you will need in the conventional phase (60+) of your retirement.

	The quality of investments your employer offers for your 401(k) will vary. You want to look for index-based investments: funds that refer to the "Dow Jones Industrial Average" or "S&P/Fidelity/Vanguard 500". Not all 401(k)s will offer safe, quality investments; this is where talking to your fiduciary investment adviser will come in. My advice is to take any investment available that tracks a major stock market index; if it's not available, and you have a match, take the most stable one they offer (typically a bond investment). If you're 30+, I'd suggest taking a mix of stocks and bonds. We'll discuss investment choices more in the next section.

# Invest in Boring Stuff

Investing scared me off for a while because I had precisely no idea how to actually invest in the first place. So we'll run through this quickly, eliminate the very bad ideas, and leave you with a good "quickstart" guide.

There's a *lot* of bullshit in the investment world, which doesn't help a newbie navigate it. Even millionaire "accredited" investors are rountinely wooed by commercials on Bloomberg or CNBC promising them "above-average" returns at low risk, all of which tend to end up being a load of underperforming crap compared to very "boring" investments. Nothing fancy, flashy, or trendy makes real money in the investment world (except in fees, for the one who runs it). So just *buy grandma shit*: an agonizingly boring, well-diversified, low-cost mix of stocks and bonds.

## Choice of Broker

First, you'll need a *broker*: a service that gives you access to various exchange-listed investments. The one I personally use is <a href="https://robinhood.com">Robinhood</a>. Robinhood boasts a fee-free structure for the things you'll be doing, and also offers some more advanced features you can use if you care to learn more about them. I chose Robinhood for this article because it's perhaps the easiest to use for long-term investing, boasting a well-designed smartphone user experience designed from the bottom up to be elegant and easy-to-use. It's not your only choice for broker, however, and the web interface is an obvious afterthought given how shitty it works compared to the smartphone app. I would encourage you to compare Robinhood to other brokers available and see if it's right for you.

There's other trendy brokers such as Betterment that purport to invest your money actively for you, using some combination of professional traders and algorithms that operate based on goals you define. You may find this a good option, if you don't mind the fees for everything you can easily do yourself. Additionally, very few actively-managed funds have ever outperformed the two we're about to discuss. Again - buy boring.

## Stocks vs. Bonds

You may have heard every investment portfolio should consist of "stocks" and "bonds". To this end, you'll be using Robinhood to buy two funds in particular: SPY, the S&P 500 index ETF and BND, the Vanguard Total Bond index. In (very) brief, SPY is a well-diversified, high-quality stock portion of your investments. It tracks the top 500 American companies (by total share value aka market capitalisation) at any point in time; therefore, it is a good approximation for "the whole (US) market". Additionally, it's got a low expense ratio - 0.09% of the price of SPY at any given time is taken for fund operation as of this writing. BND tracks the bond market in a similar way, and at similar low cost.

## Expected Return (and loss)

In a good, healthy market, you can expect about 8% a year annually on average out of SPY and 4% annually out of BND. That's about as good as it gets for an investment with a good risk-to-reward ratio; 8% annually is the figure many cite when they refer to trying to beat "the market". Here's my advice: don't try to "beat the market". Don't try to beat it yourself by picking individual stocks, or a specialty private fund that doesn't track a stock index. It's not worth the additional risk. 8% annually on stocks and 4% on bonds is a very attractive, safe, sane return. You may have heard about other investments on the radio or television, such as ones in cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) or real estate, promising "above-average" returns. The tricky thing is; they may be able to do it one year, but seldom can maintain the momentum. Meanwhile, the top 500 American companies have a history of reliably returning about 8% on average - it's tough to beat that record. Just don't bother.

Again: stay *boring*. Don't try tricks with options, or shorting. Don't even buy individual companies. SPY and BND: they're all you need.

Worried about losing *all* your money in the stock market? Remember that SPY tracks the performance of the *top 500 companies*. If the S&P 500 index were ever to drop 100%, it would take a life-changing disaster that permanently alters the state of world geopolitics. Money itself probably wouldn't be worth much in that scenario - but guns certainly would be. If you're looking for a worst-case loss scenario, the 2008 recession is probably a good and realistic estimation.

**DON'T PANIC SELL!** Should you lose a portion of your money, it is perhaps the *worst* time to sell. By 2012, the S&P came back from the 2008 crisis - if you had bought the tip in 2008, you'd have held the bag for just under four years, and that's the most extreme example I can think of off the top of my head. So if you find yourself in the red, sit tight, and keep on buyin'. For a good and boring index fund like SPY, every time you keep buying, you lower your total cost, and getting back into the black inches closer and closer with every purchase. As long as America exists, *it's probably all gonna come back*.

## Proportions and rebalancing

In what proportion should you buy SPY and BND? An often cited bond holding is "your age in bonds", and is the position I personally recommend. So if you're 30 years old, buy 30% in bonds, and 70% in stocks. At the end of every year, you should buy and sell to maintain this proportion as the market changes and as you near retirement. Robinhood makes it easy by showing you the percent of your portfolio each holding consumes.

# Early Retirement

If you make it all the way to diligent, careful investing, you can begin thinking about early retirement. Time is something we rarely consider when talking about money. Every frivolous expense, every expensive car, every unnecessary debt - they add up to extra years spent working that you could have been spending at home, living off investment interest! That's right - by orienting your priorities, it's entirely possible to get to a point where you don't even have to work, far before what is normally considered retirement age. This is generally the "final boss" of personal finance. Given an investment earnings rate of 8% annually (cited above as the average return rate of SPY), it's generally considered "safe" to withdraw about half of those earnings yearly and still retain enough capital to last you the remainder of retirement. With total holdings of $1.5 million dollars, a 4% annual withdrawal can net you around $60,000 a year - for doing absolutely nothing except holding a stake in your investments. Not bad.

If $1.5 million dollars sounds like a lot, it isn't - with diligence, it's entirely possible to invest your way up to this point over a period of two or three decades. Starting in your twenties can give you an extra 10-15 years of retirement. A big part of how you get here is *compound interest*. In (very) short, compounding works for you like credit card interest works against you - you take dividends paid by your investments, reinvest them into your index fund holdings, and you get to your goal ever sooner, just a little more each time. For more info on compound interest, see <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/university/beginner/beginner2.asp">this.</a>

I dunno about you, but I've concluded long ago that life is too short to work all this extra time for things that, frankly, I can do without. Is a new BMW every few years and a giant house in the city worth *decades* of extra time at work? Eliminating debt, downsizing your lifestyle, taking full advantage of your work benefits, and investing (sanely) can help you get to a point where you *don't even have to fucking go to work*. That - in my opinion - is the only luxury worth saving for. Give what I talked about some thought, and call up a fiduciary investment adviser to ask about how to finally get there.
